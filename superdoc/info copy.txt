Chloroplasts are a type of plastid—a round, oval, or disk-shaped body that is 
involved in the synthesis and storage of foodstuffs. Chloroplasts are 
distinguished from other types of plastids by their green colour, which results 
from the presence of two pigments, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. A 
function of those pigments is to absorb light energy for the process of 
photosynthesis. Other pigments, such as carotenoids, are also present in 
chloroplasts and serve as accessory pigments, trapping solar energy and 
passing it to chlorophyll. In plants, chloroplasts occur in all green tissues, 
though they are concentrated particularly in the parenchyma cells of the leaf 
mesophyll. 
### Key Features of Chloroplasts:
- **Primary function**: Photosynthesis in plant and algal cells  
- **Biosynthetic roles**:
  - Amino acid production
  - Fatty acid synthesis
  - Terpene creation
- **Membrane systems**:
  - Outer envelope
  - Inner envelope
  - Thylakoid membranes
- **Aqueous compartments**:
  - Intermembrane space
  - Stroma
  - Thylakoid lumen
